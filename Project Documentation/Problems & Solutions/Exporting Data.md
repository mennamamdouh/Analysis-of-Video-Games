### All I wanted to do is to export some tables from my database into csv files ###

The commands that do this task is:
```
SELECT field1, field2, ... FROM table_name
INTO OUTFILE 'path\file_name.csv'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
```
The error is

> Error Code: 1290. The MySQL server is running with the â€“secure-file-priv option so it cannot execute this statement

### About the secure-file-priv ###

The --secure-file-priv option is a system variable used by MySQL to limit the ability of the users to export or import data from the database server. It shows some issues when using the command like:

```
LOAD DATA INTO FILE --> This imports data from an external file into the database
```

or

```
SELECT data INTO OUTFILE --> This selects data to export to an external file out of the database
```

### To overcome those issues ###
The secure-file-priv parameter is in a system file called 'my.ini' at the path 'C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0'. To solve these problems we've to set this parameter by NULL or "" (empty string).

So, do the following:
1. Open this file (my.ini)
2. Search for secure
3. Set it as empty string as the following image

Then restart your MySQL service and try again to export the data using the commands above.

### About the my.ini file ###
You may face an issue about this file, that is it cannot be changed.

After trying to save this file  once you've changed the secure-file-priv parameter this error may occur:
