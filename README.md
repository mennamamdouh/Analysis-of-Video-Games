    - Creating a database

2. Data exploration phase ([Documentation](https://github.com/mennamamdouh/Analysis-of-Video-Games/blob/main/Project%20Documentation/Data%20Exploration%20Phase.md))

    - Showing tha columns of each table
  
    - Understanding what each column represents
  
    - Showing top records of each table
  
3. Data analysis phase ([Documentation](https://github.com/mennamamdouh/Analysis-of-Video-Games/blob/main/Project%20Documentation/Data%20Analysis%20Phase.md)) -> The phase at which the questions are answered. This is done using:
 
    - SQL simple queries such as SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE, JOINs, Grouping, and Ordering
