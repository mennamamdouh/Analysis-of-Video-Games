### The project is divided into 4 phases ###

1. Importing the data into a database

&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;This phase includes the creation of a database, the creation of its tables, and importing data into the database.

2. Data exploration phase

&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;This phase is just about exploring the data itself, showing the columns of each table, understanding what each column represents, and showing some of the records of each table.

3. Data analysis phase

&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;This phase is the phase at which the questions are answered. In this phase, I've used:

&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp; 1. SQL simple queries such as SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE, JOINs, Grouping and Ordering

&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp; 2. Complex queries such as CTEs and Sub-queries

&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp; 3. Some aggregate functions such as SUM, AVG, and COUNT

4. Reporting and documentation
